#Package Example - URL Validator <span style="font-size:0.6rem">(ur rly lyv validator)</span>
`($packageExample == ($phpPackageTemplate && $csvUrlValidatorThing))`

##Description
>_This is just an example I made following Modern PHP by Josh Lockhart._

Ever wanted to validate a batch of URLs? Know how to install php _AND_ use the command line? Not sure how you ended up here? 

Stop. Breate. This is probably real. <span style="font-size:0.6rem">It's too mundane not to be.</span> 

##Installation Instructions
1. Clone the project.
2. Run `composer install`
   
##Usage Instructions
1. Create an array of URLs.
2. Pass the URLs to the **Scanner** class `$scanner = new \JollyBlueMan\UrlValidator\Scanner($urls);`
2. Retrieve the invalid URLs with `$scanner->getInvalidUrls();`

##Testing Instructions
Testing this works best when you run the code and then check what the results are.
>>**Tips:**
> 1. Make sure you have error reporting switched on for PHP.
> 2. Enable internet connection on device (make sure that if enabled, aeroplane mode is disabled as well as disabled from being enabled).
> 3. Include URLs that are _definitely_ valid (try going to them first to check).
> 4. Try to include invalid URLs too, something silly like `isitgeorgemichael.today`.

##Contributing Instructions
1. Just don't.

##Author Credits
I'd love to take all the credit for this, but alas it was my upbringing combined with external factors, and my 
inherent nature that created this nonsense. If it wasn't me, it would have been someone else. 
<span style="font-size:0.6rem">Oh and Josh Lockhart _technically_ wrote all the code, so there's that.</span>
